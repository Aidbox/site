Aidbox supported 3 types of Oauth authorization:

1. __Implicit__ for browser-based or mobile apps
2. __Authorization Code__ for apps running on a web server
3. __Client credentials__ for application access

There is available by default __implicit__ client with id __site__. You can view a list of available clients, 
add new or edit existing clients on the __Client__ page in the box [dashboard](/dashboard.html#/). 
See [RFC6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for more information about OAuth 2.0 authorization.
